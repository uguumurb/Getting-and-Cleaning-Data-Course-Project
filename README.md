This repository is created to deposit the files for Getting and Cleaning
Data - Course Project. The repository containst the R script,
run\_analysis.R, which does the following:

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data
    set with the average of each variable for each activity and each
    subject.

The tidy data set from final step 5 is available in 2ndTidyTable.txt.
GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available
codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries
calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
